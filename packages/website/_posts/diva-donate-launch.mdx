DIVA Technologies AG, in collaboration with Fortune Connect and Shamba Network, is excited to 
announce the launch of DIVA Donate, a platform designed to facilitate conditional donations, 
powered by DIVA Protocol, a versatile blockchain-based operating system for derivative products. 
Read the partnership announcement to learn more.

In this article, we will share all the information you need to know about our first campaign, how 
you can participate and the rewards available to those who join us in our mission to create a 
positive impact on the world.

## About the first campaign

The first campaign is focused on providing financial assistance to pastoralists in the Eastern 
Horn of Africa, who face regular droughts caused by climate change and extreme weather events, 
resulting in curtailed agricultural production, destroyed crops and extreme livestock losses.

The goal of the campaign is to raise $15’000 to provide 100 pastoralists with financial support 
of up to $150 per pastoralist, equivalent to the value of one livestock, in the event of a drought.

The DIVA Protocol founding team is leading the way by seeding the campaign with $5’000 and will 
match any donation of at least $150, up to a total of $5’000.

## What is the trigger metric?

The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a commonly used metric to assess drought 
conditions in an area by measuring vegetation density and health. It is calculated from 
satellite images based on the near-infrared and red light reflectance of an area. Its 
value ranges from -1 to 1, with higher values indicating healthier vegetation and lower 
values indicating drought stress.

For this campaign, the average NDVI observed between 1st March and 31th May 2023 will be 
used as the trigger metric and reported by the Shamba oracle on 11th June to ensure full data coverage of the 
observation period. The NDVI will be shifted by 1 for technical reasons.

Donations will become available when the chosen metric falls below a value of 1.23 and the 
percentage of unlocked funds will increase linearly until it reaches 100% when the value 
drops to 1.20 or lower. This range represents the 20th to 40th percentile, respectively, 
based on historical data, and is more generous than other insurance products that use a 
binary trigger point set at the 5th percentile.

The donation profile of the first campaign is depicted below:

## Who will receive the donation?

While our ultimate goal is to enable beneficiaries like pastoralists to directly receive 
their tokenized insurance and any unlocked donations through their mobile wallets without 
relying on intermediaries, we recognize that we are still early and many are not yet familiar
 with managing blockchain assets. 

Therefore, Fortune Connect will serve as the local intermediary and recipient of donations
 on behalf of the pastoralists. Any unlocked donations will be converted from USDT stablecoin
  into the local fiat currency, Kenyan Shillings, and distributed to eligible pastoralists 
  through the local mPesa mobile payment system.

## How to participate?
Participating in the campaign is simple if you have a browser wallet with USDT on Polygon. 
Just visit the pilot campaign page, enter the amount you wish to donate, press the "Donate" 
button, and confirm the transaction in your browser wallet. Note that you may be asked to 
"Approve" the transfer first in order to grant DIVA protocol the permission to move the 
donation asset on your behalf.

For those new to crypto, there is a one-time setup process to go through to set up a wallet 
and convert your local currency into crypto assets. Refer to our FAQs for more guidance. 
If you need help to get started, don’t hesitate to reach out to wladimir.weinbender@divadonate.xyz.

Donations will be accepted until 13th April or until the $15’000 goal is met.

## What’s in for you?

As a donor, you will receive a unique digital certificate in the form of an NFT to commemorate 
your contribution and showcase your social responsibility to others. The POAP will come in two 
different designs: one with a golden ring for those who donate $150 or more and one with a 
silver ring for those who donate less. 

In addition, donors will receive a claim on 450 DIVA Tokens for every $150 donated, which will 
allow them to be among the first to participate in the DIVA governance once the system goes 
live on the Ethereum mainnet in April. Learn more about the role of the DIVA Token here.
