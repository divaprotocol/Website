DIVA Technologies AG, in collaboration with [Fortune Connect](https://fortuneconnectltd.com/) and 
[Shamba Network](https://shamba.network/), is excited to announce the launch of [DIVA Donate](http://divadonate.xyz/), the first 
platform designed to facilitate conditional donations using blockchain technology, more precisely [DIVA Protocol](https://www.divaprotocol.io/), a versatile blockchain-based operating system for derivative products. 
Learn more about it in one of our last [posts](https://www.divaprotocol.io/posts/diva-conditional-donations).

In this article, we will share all the information you need to know about our first campaign, how 
you can participate and the rewards available to those who join us in our mission to create a 
positive impact on the world.

## About the first campaign

The first campaign is focused on providing financial assistance to pastoralists in Kenya, a region that faces regular droughts caused by climate change and extreme weather events, 
resulting in reduced agricultural production, destroyed crops and extreme livestock losses.

The goal of the campaign is to raise $15â€™000 to provide 100 pastoralists with financial support 
of up to $150 per pastoralist, equivalent to the value of one livestock, in the event of a drought. 
The area of focus is illustrated below.

**The DIVA Protocol founding team is leading the way by seeding the campaign with $5â€™000 and will 
match any donation of at least $150, up to a total of $5â€™000.**

The initiation of the conditional donation product can be verified on the [blockchain](https://polygonscan.com/tx/0x4364d0f2d0bac0d8dba38c5e95a0c472ffaa7c0395718faec4627f9120cb7ecb).


## What is the trigger metric?

The [Normalized Difference Vegetation Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalized_difference_vegetation_index) (NDVI) is a commonly used metric to assess drought 
conditions in an area by measuring vegetation density and health. It is calculated from 
satellite images based on the near-infrared and red light reflectance of an area. Its 
value ranges from -1 to 1, with higher values indicating healthier vegetation and lower 
values indicating drought stress.

For this campaign, the average NDVI observed between 1st March and 31th May 2023 will be 
used as the trigger metric and reported by the Shamba oracle on 11th June to ensure full data coverage of the 
observation period. The NDVI will be shifted by 1 for technical reasons.

Donations will become available when the chosen metric falls below a value of 1.23 and the 
percentage of unlocked funds will increase linearly until it reaches 100% when the value 
drops to 1.20 or lower. This range represents the 20th to 40th percentile, respectively, 
based on historical data, and is much more generous than other comparable insurance products that use a 
binary trigger point set at the 5th percentile.

The donation profile of the first campaign is illustrated below:

## Who will receive the donation?

While our ultimate goal is to enable beneficiaries like pastoralists to directly receive 
their tokenized contingent claims and any unlocked donations through their mobile wallets without 
relying on intermediaries, we recognize that we are still early and many are not yet familiar
 with managing blockchain assets. 

Therefore, Fortune Connect will serve as the local intermediary and recipient of donations
on behalf of the pastoralists. Any unlocked donations will be converted from USDT stablecoin
into the local fiat currency, Kenyan Shillings, and distributed to eligible pastoralists 
through the local mPesa mobile payment system without them needing to do anything.

## How to participate?

Participating in the campaign is simple if you have a browser wallet with USDT on Polygon. 
Just visit the [pilot campaign page](https://divadonate.xyz/campaign), enter the amount you wish to donate, press the "Donate" 
button, and confirm the transaction in your browser wallet. Note that you may be asked to 
"Approve" the transfer first in order to grant DIVA Protocol the permission to move the 
donation asset on your behalf. For a step-by-step guide, you can also check out our
[video tutorial ðŸ“¹](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEqURXve5CE&t=4s).

For those new to crypto, there is a one-time setup process to go through to [set up a wallet ](https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/develop/metamask/hello/)
and [convert](https://www.coinbase.com/) your local currency into crypto assets. Refer to our [FAQs](https://divadonate.xyz/faq) for more guidance. 
If you need support, head over to the diva-donate channel in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/8fAvUspmv3) and ask your questions.

**Donations will be accepted until 13th April or until the $15â€™000 goal is met.**

## Whatâ€™s in for you?

As a donor, you will receive a unique digital certificate in the form of an NFT to commemorate 
your contribution and showcase your social responsibility to others. The POAP will come in two 
different designs: one with a golden ring for those who donate $150 or more and one with a 
silver ring for those who donate less.

  <img src="/images/posts/POAP_ConditionalDonation1_Silver.png" style={{ width: '45%', height: 'auto', display: 'inline-block', padding: '20px' }}/>
</p>

Note that POAPs will be distributed **after** the campaign is closed for donations, that is as soon as the fundraising goal of $15'000 is reached or latest after 13th April.

In addition, donors that donate at least $15 will receive a claim on 3 DIVA Tokens for every $1 donated, which will 
allow them to be among the first to participate in the DIVA governance once the system goes 
live on the Ethereum mainnet in April.

## About DIVA Technologies AG

DIVA Technologies AG is a Swiss based software consulting firm that consults traditional businesses as 
well as DAOs in Web3 related topics. The company was founded in 2022 by Wladimir Weinbender, 
Co-Founder of DIVA Protocol, a smart contract-based operating system for derivative products.

## About Fortune Connect

## About Shamba Network

Shamba Network powers an oracle that enables the collection, analytics and use of ecological data on-chain. It provides the web3 ecosystem with 
infrastructure that allows insight into the physical world, enabling things like ecological impact to be monitored. Through the Shamba oracle, 
smart contracts can get updated on what is happening on the ground and use this data to trigger a wide variety of actions. 

## Risk disclaimer

The use of any smart contract-based system comes with the risk of unexpected bugs that may result in the loss of funds. 
To mitigate that risk for this pilot campaign, a permissioned and upgradeable version of the DIVA smart contract is being used until
the audit of the contracts is completed.
