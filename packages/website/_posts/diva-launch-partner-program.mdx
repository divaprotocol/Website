The DIVA Protocol smart contract is almost ready for launch! After more than 2.5 years of development and dedication, we are excited to bring the first truly universal 
and flexible smart contract based operating system for derivative applications to market. With DIVA Protocol, developers can build a wide range of derivative applications, 
including insurance, structured products, prediction markets, conditional donations, and swaps, all in a permissionless and trustless way. One of the unique features is 
the possibility to impose transfer restrictions on derivative assets, which makes it particularly well-suited for traditional financial institutions that must comply with KYC and AML regulations.

Our vision is to transform a $500+ trillion derivatives industry with a secure, transparent, and decentralized infrastructure layer that enables anyone to create and 
settle derivatives peer-to-peer. We are offering a unique opportunity to join us on our journey as an official launch partner by sponsoring a portion of the smart contract 
audit costs (estimated at $100‚Äô000). As a launch partner, you will receive recognition on our website and social media channels, as well as a claim on 300 DIVA tokens for 
every $100 sponsored which will give you an opportunity to play an active role in shaping the future direction of DIVA Protocol. 

Read on to learn what a smart contract audit is and find out how you can become a launch partner.

## What is a smart contract?

To understand the purpose of an audit, we first need to understand what a smart contract is. A smart contract is a software that runs on a 
decentralized network of computers, such as Ethereum. Once deployed, its code is replicated on thousands of machines across the globe and cannot be stopped, 
altered or changed, ensuring that it will remain accessible and functional for generations to come. 

As many smart contracts (including DIVA Protocol) implement sensitive logic related to holding and transferring digital assets, it is crucial that they are 
thoroughly tested and free from errors or vulnerabilities. That‚Äôs where the smart contract audit comes in.

## What is a smart contract audit?

A smart contract audit is a crucial part of the development process that ensures the security and reliability of the contract. It involves a thorough 
review of the code by a team of experienced blockchain developers and security experts, with the goal of identifying any vulnerabilities or weaknesses 
that could potentially compromise the security or functionality of the contract. This process requires specialized knowledge and expertise, and it can be complex and time-consuming. 

The estimated cost of the DIVA smart contract audit, as determined by [Sherlock](https://www.sherlock.xyz/), is $100,000. The completion of the audit marks a major milestone in the life cycle of the DIVA 
Protocol and offers a great opportunity to invite interested parties to participate in that historical moment by sponsoring a portion of the audit costs.

## What is the goal of the launch partner program?

The DIVA Protocol launch partner program serves a dual purpose: it offers institutions and individuals an opportunity to publicly signal their support for decentralized 
finance technologies and also helps to build a diverse and decentralized community of token holders which is essential for the success of any 
decentralized project, including DIVA Protocol.

We believe that the launch partner program is an excellent way to foster a strong and engaged community of advocates for decentralized technologies.

## What are the benefits of becoming a launch partner?

As a launch partner, you will receive public recognition on our website and our social media channels, giving you exposure to our 5.8k [Twitter](https://twitter.com/divaprotocol_io) 
followers and 33k [Discord](https://discord.gg/DE5b8ZeJjK) members. Plus, for every $100 you contribute, you will receive a claim on 300 DIVA tokens, allowing you to be among the 
first to participate in the DIVA governance once the system goes live on Ethereum mainnet (expected in March 2023, shortly after completion of the 
smart contract audit). Learn more about the role of the DIVA token [here](https://www.divaprotocol.io/posts/diva-tokenomics).

Please note that launch partners will be subject to the same DIVA token vesting terms as the Genesis team and early backers. That is, 40% of the 
allocated DIVA tokens will be unlocked at the token generation event and 60% will vest linearly over a period of 2 years.
