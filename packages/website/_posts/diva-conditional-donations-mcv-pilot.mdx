**TL;DR: [DIVA Donate](https://www.divadonate.xyz/), an innovative conditional donation platform developed by [DIVA Technologies AG](https://www.divaprotocol.io/) in collaboration with [Fortune Connect](https://fortunecredit.co.ke/) 
and [Shamba Network](https://shamba.network/), has partnered up with [Mercy Corps Ventures](https://www.mercycorps.org/what-we-do/ventures) (MCV) to harness the potential of blockchain technology to positively 
impact the lives of vulnerable communities in the Horn of Africa.**

In early 2023, MCV has announced the [launch of its second Crypto For Good Fund](https://medium.com/mercy-corps-social-venture-fund/real-world-use-cases-for-web3-in-emerging-markets-launching-the-crypto-for-good-fund-ii-40c9516eb1bf) with the goal to drive global financial 
inclusion and climate resilience through a series of pilots, demonstrating the scalability of blockchain-enabled solutions 
in making a positive impact in emerging markets. 

Out of a competitive pool of 200 applicants, DIVA Donate emerged as one of the winners, a testament to the team‚Äòs commitment 
to demonstrate that blockchain is more than just speculation; it can be a force for positive change for millions worldwide.

## üõ°Ô∏è Empowering Kenyan pastoralists

The collaborative efforts between DIVA Donate and MCV will focus on leveraging blockchain technology to provide anticipatory 
cash transfers to pastoralist communities in Kenya, specifically in the counties of Kajiado and Laikipia. These communities 
heavily depend on livestock and livestock products for their livelihoods and are disproportionately affected by 
climate-change-induced drought. Read the official pilot announcement [here](https://agfundernews.com/mercy-corps-ventures-pilots-the-blockchain-to-get-cash-transfers-to-communities-ahead-of-climate-shock).

## ‚ú® How it works

Users participate in the campaign by depositing funds in the form of the [USDT stablecoin](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xc2132D05D31c914a87C6611C10748AEb04B58e8F) through the [DIVA Donate](https://www.divadonate.xyz/campaign/pastoralists-mcv) web application. 
These funds are held trustlessly inside the DIVA Protocol smart contract on the [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) blockchain and released to beneficiaries based on the average [Normalized Difference Vegetation Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalized_difference_vegetation_index) (NDVI) observed during the period Q4 2023 reported by the remote-sensed data oracle [Shamba Network](https://shamba.network/).

The NDVI is a commonly used metric to assess drought conditions in an area by measuring 
vegetation density and health. If the value falls below a critical level, a donation payment will be triggered. If vegetation 
remains healthy during the monitoring period, the user can reclaim their funds and redeploy them in the next campaign, 
thereby maximizing impact.

The donation amount varies based on county-specific profiles influenced by historical 30th, 50th, & 80th percentiles for Kajiado (1.45, 1.47, & 1.51) and Laikipia (1.54, 1.59, & 1.64). 
The chosen profiles exhibit a gradual increase from the 80th to the 50th percentile, resulting in a 20% donation, followed by an accelerated increase 
to 100% donation between the 50th and 30th percentiles, reflecting the increasing severity of drought conditions and the greater demand for financial support. 
The donation profiles for the two counties are depicted below.

</p>

Deposits will be automatically split 50/50 between the two programmatic escrows created for each region. Consequently, the released donation amount 
represents the average between the payouts for these two regions. 

<u>Example</u>: If the outcome is 1.44 for Kajiado and 1.59 for Laikipia,
then 60% of the deposited funds will be disbursed as a donation and 40% will be reclaimable by the depositing user. If the outcome is 1.45 for Kajiado and 1.54 for Laikipia, 100% of the deposited funds will be released as donation.
No donation is released if the outcome exceeds 1.51 for Kajiado and 1.64 for Laikipia.

## üåßÔ∏è Anticipatory aid

The observation period Q4 2023 represents the rainy season, followed by a dry season. This is where the anticipatory nature 
of the pilot comes into play. If during the rainy season, rainfall falls below the critical threshold, as implied by the 
donation profile, donations are triggered, providing vital financial support for the upcoming, more challenging dry season.

## ‚õìÔ∏è Benefits of using smart contracts

One of the key benefits of utilizing smart contracts is that aid is swiftly delivered in response to reported conditions 
without requiring manual intervention. Other advantages include transparent donations and an open, permissionless 
approach that allows participation from anywhere in the world with any amount at minimal cost.

## üçÄ Participate now

To participate in the campaign, head over to [DIVA Donate](https://www.divadonate.xyz/campaign/pastoralists-mcv) and deposit any amount of USDT 
to support pastoralists in Kenya in the event of drought.

Note that you will need a [Metamask wallet](https://metamask.io/), a small amount of MATIC to cover the transaction costs on Polygon (which are minimal), 
and some [USDT](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xc2132D05D31c914a87C6611C10748AEb04B58e8F). The team is working on enabling donations in fiat to abstract 
away the complexities involved in interacting with blockchain applications.

## üèÜ Rewards
As a token of appreciation, donors will receive a digital certificate known as a POAP to commemorate their contribution. 
Donations of $75 or more will receive the golden-ring POAP. Smaller contributions will be rewarded with the silver POAP.
