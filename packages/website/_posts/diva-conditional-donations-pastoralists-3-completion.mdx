**TL;DR:** The [third campaign](https://www.divaprotocol.io/posts/diva-conditional-donations-pastoralists-3)
concluded on 10 June 2024. No donation payment was triggered due to favorable vegetation
conditions. **All participants can claim back their contributions, totaling $8'632.60.**

## üåç Outcome

The [NDVI](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalized_Difference_Vegetation_Index) value as of 31 May 2024, used to assess vegetation and drought conditions at the
onset of the dry season, was recorded at 0.72 on 10 June 2024, the time when the outcome reporting commenced. 
This value significantly exceeded the threshold value of 0.57, marking it as the second highest in recorded history.
According to the predefined criteria for donation release payouts, no payout was triggered 
(the shift by 1 in the NDVI value is for technical reasons and does not affect the outcome).

</p>

Below is a graphic that puts the outcome into historical context by comparing it to previous
years that would have triggered a payout due to drought conditions (2014, 2015, 2017, 2022,
2023) according to the established payoff profile, alongside the maximum value recorded in
2018 (0.74).

  <em>Please note that due to the smoothing algorithm used by FEWS, past values may be revised
  retroactively. For instance, the NDVI value for May 31, 2024, was initially reported at 0.72
  on June 10. It was later adjusted to 0.71 on June 12, and reduced further to 0.69 by June 23.</em>
</p>

The outcome aligns with the assessments from Kenya's National Drought Management Authority
(NDMA) detailed in their monthly reports for [March](http://knowledgeweb.ndma.go.ke/Public/Resources/ResourceDetails.aspx?doc=ae30158c-9ef7-436c-b441-a0f5b2e35c15), 
[April](http://knowledgeweb.ndma.go.ke/Content/LibraryDocuments/Kajiado_DEW_Bulletin-_April_2024.20240521152125.pdf), and [May](http://knowledgeweb.ndma.go.ke/Public/Resources/ResourceDetails.aspx?doc=9681f74b-546b-4552-b11b-92605e8f10db). 
An excerpt from the April report, the peak month of the "Long Rains" season, describes the conditions on the ground:

> Due to continued enhanced rainfall during the month, water is adequately available. Open water sources are 
90%-100% recharged, silted too due to floods; rivers overflowing to vicinity. They are expected to last for 
about four to five months. Vegetation condition above normal. Pasture and browse conditions are very good, 
but heavily flooded. Livestock body condition is very good. Milk production slightly above normal due to 
increased calving. No migration, but moved to higher grounds due to floods in some areas. No Livestock mortalities due to drought.

## ‚ú® Contributions

A total of $8'632.60 was contributed to the campaign, with the majority consisting of Mercy Corps Ventures (MCV)
funds rolled over from the previous campaign by the DIVA Donate team. Additionally, $70 was
contributed by two external users from the DIVA Protocol community.

## üîÆ Outcome reporting via Tellor

The third campaign tested the use of the [Tellor Oracle](https://tellor.io/) for outcome reporting. Tellor is a
decentralized oracle system employing a network of reporters to relay off-chain data to the blockchain.
Reporters are required to post a financial bond of approximately $10,000 prior to reporting,
which may be forfeited in the event of inaccurate reporting, ensuring data accuracy and
integrity. Crucially, using a decentralized oracle system eliminates the risk of a single point of failure, 
enhancing the system's resilience and reliability.

A comprehensive [guide](https://docs.divaprotocol.io/technical-blog/ndvi-outcome-reporting-guide-for-tellor-reporters) on how to source and report the NDVI value was published for Tellor
reporters before campaign expiry.

The timeline of the outcome reporting related events is summarized below:
- The campaign expired on 10 June 2024, at 06:00:00 PM UTC, opening a 7-day window for outcome
reporting.
- Just 16 minutes later, the NDVI value was reported by a Tellor reporter ([tx link](https://polygonscan.com/tx/0xac50ec16204a6fe3fb7e75a89453a1a5f74ea106440e6919401e9cade676af42)).
- After remaining undisputed for 12 hours, a key requirement to ensure data accuracy, the value
was confirmed and pushed to DIVA Protocol for settlement ([tx link](https://polygonscan.com/tx/0x70496cff069b1448b375f58e1385e071bea72bdcd20b2b6e7e6e594e968b36a7)).

The reporting via Tellor Protocol went smoothly, eliminating the 14-hour delay experienced in
the previous campaign due to suboptimal timing configuration in the oracle. Combined with
Tellor's shorter 12-hour dispute period versus DIVA Protocol's conservative three-day period,
this improvement significantly reduced the time for final value confirmation to 12 hours, down
from 86 hours previously.

## üèÜ POAPs

As a token of appreciation, participants received a digital certificate (so-called POAP) to
commemorate their contribution which can be viewed [here](https://collectors.poap.xyz/en-us/scan). Donations of $75 or more received the golden-ring POAP.
Smaller contributions were rewarded with the silver POAP.

## üí° Key Learnings

This section summarizes the key takeaways from the third campaign.

### Smooth reporting process via Tellor Oracle:
The integration of the Tellor Oracle improved final value confirmation times by over 80%,
reducing disbursement delays in the event of a payout.

### Carefully study new datasets before using them as trigger metrics:

The campaign utilized the publicly available, smoothed NDVI dataset from the [USGS Famine
Early Warning System Network (FEWS)](https://earlywarning.usgs.gov/fews/product/902#documentation), 
which corrects for cloud coverage and atmospheric contamination. Post-launch, it was discovered that 
the dataset‚Äôs smoothing algorithm retroactively adjusts historical observations. For example, the NDVI 
value for May 31, 2024, initially reported at 0.72 on June 10, subsequently dropped to 0.71 by June 12 
and further to 0.69 by June 23.

To mitigate confusion and prevent costly disputes, we highlighted this fact in the [Tellor reporting guide](https://docs.divaprotocol.io/technical-blog/ndvi-outcome-reporting-guide-for-tellor-reporters) 
and provided additional instructions on which value to report, including a recommendation to document 
submissions through video recording. The recording from the Tellor reporter who submitted the NDVI value 
of 0.72 for the third campaign can be found [here](https://www.loom.com/share/f5849a5edc9c44e88c5ad4352b8f4d3b). For future campaigns utilizing the FEWS dataset, these 
details should be clarified in the [reference asset specifications](https://bafybeibdjwmxn3r7cxx4bqqolqp3qib6l2co6mdrqh46ry2ab7cgbsamtu.ipfs.w3s.link/tellor_reference_asset_kajiado.json) already.

This situation emphasizes the importance of fully understanding the dataset and clearly communicating 
the reporting requirements to avoid costly disputes.

### Challenges in user onboarding:

Participation was limited to only two external users with a total amount of $70, primarily 
due to low marketing activities and the barrier of requiring web3 knowledge for participation. 
Moving forward, we will focus on forming partnerships with NGOs and securing grant funding 
to engage fewer, but more impactful, participants who can contribute more substantially in 
terms of dollar amounts to the campaigns. However, we want to emphasize that external users 
will still be able to participate in the campaigns.

### Clarifying expectations for beneficiaries

Despite prior explanations about the conditional nature of the program, pastoralists onboarded for the 
campaign anticipated guaranteed payouts, mistaking the onboarding process for a pledge of funds at season‚Äôs end. 
To prevent such misunderstandings, we plan to transition to group onboarding strategies. This method distributes 
funds to established groups representing the pastoralists, who then allocate the funds internally, simplifying the 
process for future campaigns by reducing the frequency of individual onboarding.

### Add protection against flooding:

While rainfall is generally beneficial for vegetation, excessive rainfall, like that observed in April, 
can lead to flooding. To provide protection against excessive rainfall, the campaign payout could be 
structured to cover both scenarios ‚Äì too little and too much rain. This dual-trigger strategy will be 
explored in future campaigns to better protect against the two extremes.

## üîç Transparency

While this article focuses on the outcomes and insights from our third campaign, it also presents an opportunity 
to underscore the transparent nature of the processes at DIVA Donate. Given the 
inherent transparency of blockchain technology, all details and transactions related to the campaign 
can be independently verified. Please note that some information may be encoded in a format that is 
not directly interpretable without specific knowledge or decoding tools (e.g., 1720000000000000000 
corresponds to 1.72).

### Outcome reporting steps

The two transactions involved in the outcome reporting via the Tellor Oracle can be accessed here:
* [NDVI value submission to Tellor Protocol](https://polygonscan.com/tx/0xac50ec16204a6fe3fb7e75a89453a1a5f74ea106440e6919401e9cade676af42): 
This is the initial step where the NDVI value is submitted to the Tellor Protocol by Tellor reporters.
* [NDVI value submission from Tellor Protocol to DIVA Protocol](https://polygonscan.com/tx/0x70496cff069b1448b375f58e1385e071bea72bdcd20b2b6e7e6e594e968b36a7): 
If a reported NDVI value remains undisputed for at least 12 hours, anyone can trigger the push of the value from Tellor Protocol to DIVA Protocol for final processing.

### Reported outcome

The final value (finalReferenceValue) and the respective payouts for beneficiaries (payoutShort) and participants 
(payoutLong) can be verified in the [same location](https://louper.dev/diamond/0x2C9c47E7d254e493f02acfB410864b9a86c28e1D?network=polygon#read) as the campaign setup.
