**TL;DR: The [pilot campaign with pastoralists in Kenya](https://www.divaprotocol.io/posts/diva-conditional-donations-mcv-pilot), 
launched in October on [DIVA Donate](https://www.divadonate.xyz/) in collaboration with Mercy Corps Ventures, has ended on 1st January 2024.
A total of USD 11‚Äô271 (net of all costs), or 56% of the deposited funds, were released and distributed to 262 pastoralists as financial support 
ahead of the upcoming dry season. This article reflects on the pilot, the outcome and the key learnings.**

To recap, the goal of the pilot was to leverage blockchain technology to provide anticipatory cash transfers to pastoralists in Kenya, 
specifically in the counties of Kajiado and Laikipia, in the event that the vegetation growth during the rainy season in October-November-December 
2023 is deemed insufficient to provide necessary pasture for livestock in the coming dry season.

To measure the vegetation level, the average [Normalized Difference Vegetation Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalized_difference_vegetation_index) (NDVI) was used (shifted by 1 for technical reasons). 
Higher NDVI values indicate a greater density of healthy vegetation, while lower values indicate drought stress. The following donation 
profiles were [calibrated](https://www.divaprotocol.io/posts/diva-donate-trigger-selection-methodology) for the two counties based on historical data.

## üí∞ Deposits

A total of USDT 20‚Äô235 were deposited into the campaign, which were automatically split 50/50 between the two programmatic 
escrows created for each county. Thereof, USDT 20‚Äô000 was provided by Mercy Corps Ventures and the remainder by 10 external participants.

A post-deposit survey revealed that users were satisfied with the overall donation experience on DIVA Donate, providing an average rating of 9.6 out of 10.0. 

>Super experience, well done, really! Makes you want more. 
This is how donating is fun and meaningful.‚Äù - Florian

As a token of appreciation, depositors received a digital certificate (so-called POAP) to commemorate their contribution which they can view [here](https://collectors.poap.xyz/en-us/scan). 
Donations of $75 or more received the golden-ring POAP. Smaller contributions were rewarded with the silver POAP.

## üíß Outcome reporting

On 2nd January 2024, shortly after midnight between 02:19:37 AM and 02:21:54 AM UTC, the [Shamba oracle](https://shamba.network/) automatically reported the following average NDVIs for the two counties:
* [1.4771](https://polygonscan.com/tx/0xe79e39fe3840283a5e8583340239fa85391a4ad91ea370db1b21e2aaa8234c63) for Kajiado
* [1.5136](https://polygonscan.com/tx/0xd338cf26a515dae31baf3a9bf7083f3d784b5d2b09038e42e0f12809798b4697) for Laikipia

According to the defined payoff profiles, this resulted in a donation amount of [USDT 1‚Äô657.05](https://polygonscan.com/tx/0xd8d48752af1dd2f8731b2673f7bc78b295523d90350a1901f95fa4bf6a7d5333) 
(16.43% of deposited funds) for Kajiado and [USDT 10‚Äô087.35](https://polygonscan.com/tx/0xd8d48752af1dd2f8731b2673f7bc78b295523d90350a1901f95fa4bf6a7d5333) (100% of deposited funds) for 
Laikipia (net of 0.25% DIVA Protocol fee and 0.05% reporting reward, gross of mPesa transfer and currency exchange costs). 

The remaining USDT 8‚Äô430.31 can be claimed back by participants from the [DIVA Donate website](https://www.divadonate.xyz/) and redeployed into future campaigns. In particular, any unreleased funds from Mercy Corps Ventures as well as the DIVA Protocol fee and reporting reward of USDT 60.71 will be rolled into the next campaign planned for the March-April-May rainy season.

## ü™ô Fund disbursement

The funds held within DIVA Protocol were made available shortly after midnight on 5th January, following the completion of the 3-day dispute period post-reporting. 
During this period, the accuracy of the reported data was verified and no objections were raised.

On the same day between 06:51:09 PM and 06:51:25 PM UTC, approximately 14.5 hours after the funds were released in DIVA Protocol, the funds were disbursed to 
eligible pastoralists via mPesa, Kenya‚Äôs mobile payment system. Compared to our [7-10 days baseline](https://www.fao.org/3/cc5062en/cc5062en.pdf), this represents a 
**>90% faster fund distribution compared to traditional methods**. The time lag between fund release and disbursement can be further improved by 
aligning the oracle reporting time with daytime hours.


## üçÄ Beneficiaries

At the outset of the campaign, local village champions registered 297 pastoralists. After the removal of duplicate entries and the exclusion of individuals 
without an mPesa mobile wallet or livestock, the total number reduced to 266 eligible pastoralists, in line with the pilot‚Äôs target. Out of 266 attempted 
disbursements via mPesa, four failed due to unregistered mPesa numbers. Consequently, the final disbursement reached 262 pastoralists, broken down as follows:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/posts/table_participating_pastoralists_mcv.png" />
</p>

The total disbursement amounted to **KES 1'724'463 (USD 11'271)**, with an mPesa transfer cost of KES 2'589.00 (USD 16.92) and a currency exchange cost of KES 33'580.44 (USD 219.48). 
The unspent balance of KES 36'261 (USD 237) from the four unregistered numbers will be rolled into the subsequent campaign starting in March.
Before the mPesa disbursement, each pastoralist received a notification message SMS in [Swahili](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swahili_language), translating to: _"Dear Pastoralist, DIVA Donate is 
pleased to let you know, you qualify for a donation to buy fodder. Pasture levels between Oct to Dec '23 fell below our trigger."_

## üìä Outcome Analysis
The payout presented a surprise, considering the robust rainfall attributed to the El Ni√±o phenomenon over the last couple of weeks. In fact, NDVI levels recorded in December 
reached 12-year highs for both counties. This is illustrated in the following charts which compare the October-November-December 2023 data (pink line) with previous years. 

<p align="center">

</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/posts/outcome_ndvi_laikipia_mcv.png" />
</p>

The main reason identified for this outcome was an unusual development in the NDVI curve coupled with the use of the arithmetic mean in the reference metric (1 + Average NDVI).

As can be seen from the charts, NDVI values towards the end of October / early November were exceptionally low, especially in Laikipia. In fact, the early warning reports 
for October indicated a delayed onset of the rainy season in Kajiado ([source](http://knowledgeweb.ndma.go.ke/Content/LibraryDocuments/Kajiado_DEW_Bulletin_-_October_202320231117135136.pdf)) 
and vegetation greenness being significantly below the long-term average in Laikipia ([source](http://knowledgeweb.ndma.go.ke/Public/Resources/ResourceDetails.aspx?doc=16c97a02-8ac4-462b-aefa-b34a0559ef3c)). 

Furthermore, there were unusual spikes during the initial phase of the observation period, attributed to cloud coverage, which hindered accurate vegetation measurements 
by satellites. These spikes in data were likely correlated with the onset of storms and heavy rainfall.

This unusual behavior in the NDVI curves has significantly influenced the calculation of the arithmetic mean, which is known to be susceptible to outlier bias, 
thereby skewing it toward lower values.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Key learnings

We draw the following key learnings from this pilot:

**Using the average NDVI may lead to unexpected outcomes and may not properly reflect the actual situation on the ground:**

The rationale behind choosing the average NDVI value over the last recorded value during the observation period was to address 
scenarios where the final reported value might be unavailable or influenced by cloud coverage bias. A potentially more precise 
alternative could involve using the peak NDVI value recorded in the observation period. This would likely offer a closer representation 
of the actual vegetative state and could prevent unnecessary disbursements. However, this approach relies on an assumption of generally 
increasing NDVI values, which is not always the case, as evidenced in the year 2021. Therefore, we recognize the need for further detailed 
analysis and backtesting to develop a more reliable and robust NDVI measurement strategy.

**The oracle‚Äôs reporting timing can be optimized to further accelerate the release of funds:**

The campaign officially concluded and became available for oracle reporting on January 1st, 2024, at 10 am UTC, within standard business hours. 
However, due to the Shamba oracle's configuration to check expired pools just once daily after midnight, the final NDVI report was delayed 
until 2am on January 2nd, resulting in a 14-hour lag. Adjusting the oracle's configuration to report promptly post-expiration could have 
eliminated this delay. Moreover, for platforms like DIVA Donate that run multiple campaigns using a common oracle such as Shamba, synchronizing 
their expiration times within the same daytime hours is recommended for operational efficiency.

**Improve the assessment of eligibility criteria during the pastoralists onboarding process:**

The beneficiary selection process has underscored the importance of refining our beneficiary screening methods. We faced challenges such 
as duplicate entries and the inclusion of participants lacking essential qualifications such as access to an mPesa wallet or ownership of livestock.

**The fund distribution process worked seamlessly:**

Despite the unexpected outcome of the pilot, it provided us with an opportunity to test the fund distribution process for the first time, which 
proved efficient and significantly faster compared to traditional methods.

**Onboarding people to crypto-related use cases presents a challenge:**

Only 10 external users participated in the campaign. One of the main reasons was the significant hurdle to get started with transacting on the blockchain. 
Specifically, to participate in the campaign, users were required to have a crypto wallet, such as [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), installed and funded with MATIC to cover 
gas fees on the Polygon blockchain, as well as USDT for campaign deposits.

We explored various fiat-to-crypto on-ramp options to facilitate the donor onboarding process. However, all of these options typically demanded KYC procedures, 
even for small transactions, which contradicted our objective of simplifying the process. One of the more promising solutions identified was [Coinbase Pay](https://www.coinbase.com/de/cloud/products/pay-sdk), 
which would eliminate the need for KYC since Coinbase has already completed this step, but would be only available to registered Coinbase users.

## üåî Conclusion

The pilot campaign conducted in collaboration with Mercy Corps Ventures on DIVA Donate has successfully concluded. USDT 11‚Äô271, or 56% of the deposited funds, 
were efficiently distributed to 262 pastoralists in Kenya, preparing them for the upcoming dry season. The unexpected outcome provided valuable insights into 
the use of NDVI as the underlying metric. The fund distribution process demonstrated remarkable efficiency, highlighting the potential of blockchain technology 
in humanitarian efforts. This pilot has equipped us with essential knowledge and experiences as we continue our mission to support pastoralists in the face of 
climate change challenges.
