**TL;DR: DIVA Protocol enters into a strategic collaboration with [IPOR Protocol](https://www.ipor.io/) to integrate their on-chain interest rate 
index to catalyze the creation of fully trustless interest rate derivative products.**

IPOR Protocol has pioneered interest rate swaps in DeFi. At its core is the creation of an on-chain benchmark rate, serving 
as a public utility that empowers other protocols to initiate rate dynamics through a straightforward oracle reference. 
Building upon this foundation, IPOR has introduced an AMM specifically tailored for on-chain interest rate swaps that 
allows users to lock in favorable borrowing costs or speculate on interest rate fluctuations.

The collaboration between IPOR and DIVA Protocol aims to integrate the IPOR Index to enable novel interest rate derivative 
products that complement IPOR's existing swap offerings. These include options-like products, encompassing a wide range 
of exotic payout profiles, as well as offerings focused on the DeFi and CeFi interest rate differentials.

The integration is facilitated by DIVA Protocol's approach to composability, enabling effortless incorporation with any 
oracle solution. The usage of on-chain data is particularly interesting as it eliminates the need for token-based incentives 
mechanisms to ensure integrity and accuracy.

DIVA Protocol's flexibility is exemplified by the launch of the first [ETH Gas Price market](https://www.divaprotocol.io/posts/diva-eth-gas-market-launch), offering protection against 
extended periods of high gas prices. The protocol's unparalleled flexibility in enabling the permissionless creation of a 
wide range of derivative markets holds immense promise for the future.

The integration is planned to go live after [IPOR Protocol‚Äôs v2 release](https://blog.ipor.io/the-credit-hub-of-defi-ipor-v2-1b35fcf8800c) in Q3 this year.
