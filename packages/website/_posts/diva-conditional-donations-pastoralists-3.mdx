Following the successful conditional donation campaign for the October-November-December 2023 rainy season in collaboration with Mercy Corps Ventures, 
we are excited to announce the launch of the third pilot campaign under the DIVA Donate initiative. Building upon our experiences and 
the insights gained from the previous campaigns, this new campaign introduces a more robust NDVI metric that corrects for cloud coverage 
and atmospheric contamination and tests the outcome reporting via the decentralized Tellor oracle system. 

Let‚Äôs dive in.

## ‚ú® About the campaign

In our third campaign, we remain dedicated to providing anticipatory cash transfers to pastoralist communities in Kenya, which are disproportionately affected by 
climate-change-induced drought.

The campaign‚Äôs objective is to assess vegetation health using the [Normalized Difference Vegetation Index](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalized_Difference_Vegetation_Index) (NDVI) 
following the March-April-May 2024 rainy season and disburse funds to participating pastoralists if the NDVI at the end of this period suggests insufficient vegetation to support 
livestock during the upcoming dry season.

Given a more focused fundraising target of $10‚Äô000, compared to $25‚Äô000 in the previous campaign, the campaign concentrates on Kajiado county solely. This region was a 
beneficiary in the last campaign and received 16.4% of the contributed funds.

## üìä Enhanced NDVI metric

The NDVI, sourced from satellite imagery, remains our key metric to evaluate the vegetation health on the ground. This time, however, we are utilizing a smoothed dataset from the 
[USGS Famine Early Warning System Network (FEWS)](https://earlywarning.usgs.gov/fews/product/902#documentation) that corrects for cloud coverage and atmospheric contamination.

By leveraging this enhanced dataset, we can directly use the NDVI values recorded at the end of the observation period, eliminating the need for average calculations to 
address the problem of contamination. The switch to this new dataset is a response to our last campaign's experience, where relying on average NDVI values led to skewed 
outcomes due to the influence of outliers. A comprehensive analysis and the key learnings from the previous pilot campaign are still being finalized and will be published 
in a separate article.

## üîÆ Outcome reporting

The reliability of the data reporting system is of utmost importance. In this campaign, we are adopting Tellor Oracle, 
a decentralized system that allows smart contracts to securely and reliably access data from off-chain sources. Tellor uses a decentralized network of 
staked reporters to provide this data, ensuring network integrity and discouraging false reporting. In addition, by decentralizing the data provision, 
we effectively eliminate the risk of a single point of failure, ensuring the system's resilience and reliability.

We will release a comprehensive guide specifically for Tellor reporters over the coming weeks, detailing the process for data retrieval and reporting.

## üßë‚Äçüéì Payoff calibration

The payoff calibration process involves identifying the NDVI thresholds indicative of drought conditions to trigger disbursements to pastoralists. 
The first step is to look at the NDVI data. Below chart shows the FEWS NDVI data for Kajiado county, updated every 5 days and covering the last 12 years.

The chart illustrates a recurring pattern: an increase in NDVI during the March-April-May rainy season, indicating improved vegetation, 
followed by a decline until the end of September as the dry season progresses. Low NDVI values at the end of May imply reduced fodder 
for pastoralists' livestock, forecasting tougher survival conditions through the dry months.

The chart highlights the NDVI values on 31 May for the last 12 years. The values vary between 0.45 in 2014, and 0.74 in 2018, with an 
average NDVI value of 0.59. Without additional information, it is not possible to tell whether 0.45 represents a low or high level.

To make this assessment, we have leveraged the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) maps published by the 
[National Drought Management Authority (NDMA)](http://knowledgeweb.ndma.go.ke/Public/Resources/ResourceDetails.aspx?doc=3e0a4f40-b6a7-4393-9296-be1b2a972e73) in their monthly county reports.

The VCI measures the average NDVI over a 3-month period, mapping the current vegetation health to its historical range, expressed as a percentage from 
0% to 100%. Lower VCI values indicate that vegetation health is near the historical minimum, whereas higher values indicate levels closer to the 
historical maximum. More specifically, VCI values below 20% mark severe drought conditions (highlighted by a red box), values between 20% and 35% 
indicate moderate drought (highlighted by a yellow box), and values above 35% reflect normal to optimal vegetation conditions (highlighted by a green box).

The presence of yellow or red boxes during the dry season months June, July, August, and September, suggests insufficient vegetation build-up during the 
preceding rainy season.

With this approach, we identify 2009, 2011, 2014, 2017 and 2022 as the years that experienced drought conditions. Specifically, we can see moderate 
drought conditions in 2014, 2017 and 2022 associated with NDVI levels of 0.45, 0.50, and 0.49, respectively, by the end of May. For the years 2009 
and 2011 no specific data is available, however, the presence of red boxes suggests that NDVI levels must have been even lower. Based on these 
insights, we have set a full fund release for NDVI levels at or below 0.50.

To create a more equitable payout structure, we implemented a linearly increasing payout profile, starting at 0.57, slightly below the 2012-2023 
average of 0.59. Historically, this selected payout structure would have distributed 100% of the contributed funds in 3 out of 12 cases and 0% 
in 7 out of 12 cases, underscoring the need-based approach. In the remaining two cases, the payout would have fallen within a range of 0% to 100%, 
following the linear payout curve.

The chosen payout profile for the campaign is depicted below (note that the NDVI value was shifted by +1 for technical reasons):

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Recycling contributions

Any unreleased funds contributed by the DIVA Donate team to the previous campaign ($8‚Äô430) will be recycled and redirected to support the new campaign. 
In addition, the DIVA delegate has committed himself to contribute the fees withheld by DIVA Protocol at the time of payout claim during the previous 
campaign (~$50) to the new campaign, thereby emphasizing the flexibility inherent in DIVA Protocol‚Äòs governance model.

Participants from the prior campaign are encouraged to claim any unreleased funds and amplify their impact by supporting the new campaign. If you 
haven‚Äôt claimed the funds from the previous campaign yet, learn how to do it in [this video](https://www.loom.com/share/6a37d6ac32034af4a128308c1a56f789).
