We are thrilled to announce the launch of the DIVA App ([app.diva.finance](https://app.diva.finance/)), a one-stop solution for creating, 
trading and settling bespoke derivative contracts in a peer-to-peer manner. The DIVA App is powered by three 
protocols - [DIVA Protocol](https://www.divaprotocol.io/), [0x Protocol](https://0x.org/), and [Tellor Protocol](https://tellor.io/) - offering users a seamless and fully trustless 
experience for managing the entire lifecycle of derivative contracts.

In this blog post, we are going to give you a high-level overview of the DIVA App‚Äôs functionality.

## üîó Chains

The DIVA App is currently available on Polygon, and Mumbai for testing. On Mumbai, users have the freedom to 
create and test any market using any oracle of their choice. On Polygon, the available underlyings are currently 
limited to BTC/USD, ETH/USD and TRB/USD, with the Tellor adapter as the only oracle to ensure a smooth initial user experience. 

The team plans to extend the range of underlyings based on community feedback over time. Users that wish to 
create custom markets on Polygon should reach out in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/8fAvUspmv3).

## üéØ Market Creation

The derivative contract creation is powered by DIVA Protocol, offering unparalleled customization options. 
That is, users have the freedom to select virtually any metric as the underlying and can choose from a diverse 
range of payoff profiles including different slopes, barriers, and ranges.

DIVA Protocol offers two types for market creation:
* **Pre-funded** (‚ÄúCREATE POOL‚Äù): By fully funding the derivative contract, the creator receives both position tokens, 
rendering them fully hedged. This option is useful for market makers seeking to provide liquidity on both sides 
of the derivative market.
* **Priced offer** (‚ÄúCREATE OFFER‚Äù): In this option, the creator specifies the contribution from each party 
to the derivative contract and commits to the offer terms by signing it with their private key, which is an 
off-chain process. The derivative contract is created on-chain only if a counterparty is found, thereby 
optimizing gas efficiency for users. This functionality particularly caters to use cases centered around 
bets and predictions.

## üîÆ Oracles
The Tellor adapter ([0x7950DB13cc37774614B0AA406e42a4C4f0BF26a6](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x7950DB13cc37774614B0AA406e42a4C4f0BF26a6)) was released as the first oracle integration 
for DIVA Protocol and is made available for users in the DIVA App for secure and decentralized outcome reporting. 
Learn more about the DIVA Protocol integration with Tellor Protocol in [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/WeAreTellor/status/1674804651412148226?s=20).

As the DIVA ecosystem continues to grow, additional oracle integrations will be developed, offering users a 
wider selection of reliable data sources.

## üì∏ Visualizing derivative contract offers

After creating offers through the "CREATE OFFER" option in the DIVA App, users can use the [DIVA ViZ](https://divaviz.com/) app to generate eye-catching visualizations of their derivative contract offers, 
and share them on Twitter, accompanied by the offer link.

Here's an example visualization:

## üìà Trading

The DIVA App is using 0x Protocol, a decentralized limit order protocol, to facilitate the exchange of the derivative assets. 
Leveraging an off-chain matching mechanism and an on-chain settlement process, users can create limit orders without 
incurring any gas fees (note that approving token transfers may involve a one-time gas cost, though).

One of the key advantages of using 0x Protocol for trading is that users retain full custody of their assets, unlike centralized solutions.

## üí∏ Settlement

Once the outcome of a market has been reported by the Tellor oracle, DIVA Protocol determines the payouts for participants 
and users can conveniently claim their payouts directly through the DIVA App.
