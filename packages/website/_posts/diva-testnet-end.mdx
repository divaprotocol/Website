On 30th September, the first phase of DIVA's [incentivized testnet](#https://www.divaprotocol.io/posts/diva-testnet-announcement) has ended. The goal of the testnet was to invite users to explore the
functionality of the [DIVA App](#https://app.diva.finance/), collect valueable feedback to further improve the app ahead of
the mainnet launch beginning of next year and reward participants with a claim on the future DIVA token.

The participation was overwhelming and has exceeded all our expectations. We want to say a big **THANK YOU** to everyone
who participated in our testnet. The huge participation was a real stress test for our app and helped us to iron
out some bugs that we wouldn't have spotted otherwise.

Here some key testnet statistics to highlight:

- Total contingent pools created: **170'000**
- Unique addresses participated: **26'100**
- Number accounts that completed all tasks: **13'800**
- Total points collected: **79.5m**
- Discord users: **33'000** (vs. 800 before the testnet)

## DIVA token reward
The most important metric that testnet participants are eagerly waiting for is the DIVA token reward that they receive for their participation. 
It took us a bit of time to finalize the numbers as the community requested an [additional verification step](https://www.divaprotocol.io/posts/diva-verification-announcement)
to filter out multi-accounts. That's why we go with the testnet rewards first and provide more details on the verification process as well as an outlook on the next few months 
in the following sections.

The DIVA token rewards for registered users that also passed the verification are as follows:

- **4.4** DIVA tokens per completed task (200 points)
- **100 DIVA** tokens for full completion (4500 points)
- **200 DIVA tokens** for full completion and ownership of an [888Whale NFT](https://opensea.io/collection/888whales) (9000 points)

You can check your reward on our [new website](https://www.divaprotocol.io/) üëÄ. Overall, a total of 1.12m DIVA tokens have been allocated to more than 13'600 users. That is
12% more than originally planned as we rounded up the rewards. 

If you are not eligible, don't be disappointed as we will give you additional opportunities to get your hands on the DIVA token.

## Wen token?
The DIVA token reward can be claimed at the token generation event which is planned to coincide with the mainnet launch of the DIVA Protocol in Q1 2023. As a DIVA token holder you will 
have a say in the future direction of the protocol. In particular, you will be able to vote on protocol parameters such as fees as well as how to spend the DIVA treasury funds. 
There will be a maximum of 100m tokens with the majority being distributed over time (post mainnet) to those that help grow the ecosystem around DIVA Protocol. Read more about the DIVA tokenomics 
[here](https://docs.divaprotocol.io/introduction/what-is-diva-token).

## Verification process
In this section we want to share some details about the verification process that we have conducted to filter out multi-accounts as was requested by the community. 
The goal of the additinal verification process was to identify and exclude users that participated with multiple accounts to increase their allocation at the expense of honest single account users. 
For the sake of simplicity and efficiency as well as to protect the privacy of our community members, we decided to go with the [Double Counter](https://dcounter.space/) ("DC") Discord bot. 
The DC bot calculates a score based on IP addresses, Cookies, account age and other factors to identify alt accounts. 

Let's recap the timeline:
* 8th October: announcement of the verification process on Discord and Twitter
* 14th October: start of the verification process
* 17th October: end of the verification process

Roughly 1'000 alt accounts and their corresponding main accounts (3.7m or 4.7% of total points collected) have been blocked and excluded from the reward distribution. 

Despite giving sufficient heads-up and a three day verification window, the vast majority (c. 25m or 31.4% of total points collected), didn't participate in the verification process at all. 
This could be either because they simply missed it or because they didn't try to verify their alt accounts due to the thread of losing all their rewards if identified as a multi-account. 
Users that reported technical issues during the verification process or missed the verification but reached out to us with a valid reason 
were verified manually. [888Whales NFT](https://opensea.io/collection/888whales) and quiz winners were automatically verified.

Overall, the verification process resulted in a 77% higher reward for participants.


We understand that despite the announcement 6 days ahead of the a verification process and a 3 day verification window, some users have missed the verification process due to 
personal reasons. Those that reached out via discord were added manually to the list of verified users. 


## What's next
Our main focus right now is getting the smart contracts ready for the second and final audit in January and prepare everything for the second testnet round. We will 
also continue with the quiz sessions again. Don't miss out as it will help you to prepare for the second testnet phase.

Note that the completion of all [testnet tasks](https://app.diva.finance/tasks) si mandatory to be eligible for all future reward rounds including the second testnet phase.

For those that are interested in the details of the verification process, read on.


## What comes next?

The testnet tasks will remaing available in the DIVA App. The completion of the tasks will serve as the entry ticket to all future reward rounds.

As already mentioned in some of our AMA sessions, this testnet was just the beginning. We are planning more rounds to reward users for learning and trying out DIVA Protocol. 

These include:
- Quiz
- DIVA exam
- Incentivized testnet phase 2  

Each initiative will be presented in more detail below. Participation in all initiatives assumes completion of all testnet tasks.

Learn-to-earn is the core concept underlying our token distribution strategy. We believe that this approach is more likely to convert users into long-term believers 
and supporters compared to a random airdrop model. 

### Quiz
The weekly quiz that is taking place in the DIVA discord offers users a great opportunity to earn additional DIVA tokens. Being the first answering a question yields 
100 DIVA tokens. Additional Super Quiz rounds where 10 correct user answers are possible and every users is only allowed to win once, hence giving every quiz participant a realistic chance to win. As of today, almost 25k DIVA tokens have been distributed via the quiz.
We will continue those quiz sessions for the foreseeable future to reward users that built up knowledge about DIVA Protocol. 


### Second incentivized testnet phase
The goal of the second testnet phase is to test additional features and integrations that we have been developing over the last couple of months. These include:
- Create offer flow
- Tellor oracle protocol integration

Please bear with us as we are preparing for that event. We will announce more details as soon as things are ready. 

## POAP
All testnet participants will receive a POAP that will serve as the entry ticket for the exam.

### Smart contract audit

## Mainnet launch

### Token generation event


## Bootstrapping the DIVA ecosystem
Our goal is to establish DIVA Protocol as the engine that powers a wide range of derivative applications including prediction markets, insurance platforms, structured products as well 
as event-driven conditional donations. [DIVA App](https://app.diva.finance/markets/0xBb0F479895915F80f6fEb5BABcb0Ad39a0D7eF4E) was just the beginning. To bootstrap the ecosystem, we 
are designing and implementing new applications on top of DIVA Protocol to give web2 developers inspiration and ideas what is possible. Stay tuned for more updates on that front.
