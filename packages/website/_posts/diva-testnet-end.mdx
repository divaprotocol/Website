On 30th September, the first phase of DIVA's [incentivized testnet](#https://www.divaprotocol.io/posts/diva-testnet-announcement) has ended. The goal of the testnet was to invite users to explore the
functionality of the [DIVA App](#https://app.diva.finance/), collect valueable feedback to further improve the app ahead of
the mainnet launch beginning of next year and reward participants with a claim on the future DIVA token.

The participation was overwhelming and has exceeded all our expectations. We want to say a big **THANK YOU** to everyone
who participated in our testnet. The huge participation was a real stress test for our app and helped us to iron
out some bugs that we wouldn't have spotted otherwise.

Here some key testnet statistics to highlight:

- Total contingent pools created: **170'000**
- Unique addresses participated: **26'100**
- Number accounts that completed all tasks: **13'800**
- Discord users: **33'000** (vs. 800 before the testnet)

## DIVA token reward
The most important metric that testnet participants are eagerly waiting for is the DIVA token reward that they receive for their participation. 
It took us a bit of time to finalize the numbers as the community requested an [additional verification step](https://www.divaprotocol.io/posts/diva-verification-announcement)
to filter out multi-accounts. That's why we go with the testnet rewards first and provide more details on the verification process as well as an outlook on the next few months 
in the following sections.

The DIVA token rewards for registered users that also passed the verification are as follows:

- **4.4** DIVA tokens per completed task (200 points)
- **100 DIVA** tokens for full completion (4500 points)
- **200 DIVA tokens** for full completion and ownership of an [888Whale NFT](https://opensea.io/collection/888whales) (9000 points)

You can check your reward on our [new website](https://www.divaprotocol.io/) 👀. Overall, a total of 1.12m DIVA tokens have been allocated to more than 13'600 users. That is
12% more than originally planned as we rounded up the rewards. 

If you are not eligible, don't be disappointed as we will give you additional opportunities to get your hands on the DIVA token.

## Wen token?
The DIVA token reward can be claimed at the token generation event which is planned to coincide with the mainnet launch of the DIVA Protocol in Q1 2023. As a DIVA token holder you will 
have a say in the future direction of the protocol. In particular, you will be able to vote on protocol parameters such as fees as well as how to spend the DIVA treasury funds. 
There will be a maximum of 100m tokens with the majority being distributed over time (post mainnet) to those that help grow the ecosystem around DIVA Protocol. Read more about the DIVA tokenomics

## Verification process
In this section we want to share some details about the verification process and answer the most common questions. 

To exclude users that participated with multiple accounts to increase their allocation at the expense of honest single account users, we have conducted an additional
verification step as requested by the community. We decided to go with the Double Counter Discord bot as this was considered the most simple and efficient solution which didn't require users to share 
any personal information as it would be the case with KYC. 

Let's recap the timeline:
* 8th October: announcement of the verification process on Discord and Twitter
* 14th October: start of the verification process
* 17th October: end of the verification process

Registered accounts that fall in one of the following buckets were considerd verified:
* Accounts that got verified by the Double Counter bot on first attempt
* Accounts that were blocked on first attempt because of using a VPN but got verified by the Double Counter bot on second attempt
* Accounts that hold an [888Whales NFT](https://opensea.io/collection/888whales)
* Quiz winners

The verification process increased the reward by 75% for participants.

Roughly 2'000 accounts were blocked by the Double Counter bot during the verification process. We went through all the cases to study the patterns used by 
multi-accounts. Cognizant of households, that may have share that share the same WiFi those where it was not clear. 

During this exercise we have gained valuable insights into how to catch multi-accounts. To avoid giving those users ideas how to circumvent it, we have decided not to 
share the exact details of our analysis.


Despite giving sufficient heads-up and a three day verification window, we are aware that some community members were not able to verify due to personal issues. To address 
those cases, we have launched a #verification-issues channel in our Discord where users where asked to report. 

* Users that had technical issues or missed the verification process and reported their case in the verification-issues channel
* Users that were manually unblocked due to limited evidence of multi-accounts

Users that got verified on second or third attempt have been closely looked into. 

Accounts that are suspected being multi-accounts, none of the related accounts is eligible. 

As some users have experienced technical issues during the verification process, we opened up a verification-issues channel in our Discord on 18th October to give those
users a chance to report their case. We were also encouraging users to report if they had a valid reason. Multi-accounts that tried to exploit that process to get one of 
their accounts in were identified and ignored.


Out of the 26.1k accounts that participated in the testnet, roughly 13.7k participants were considered eligible.


roughly 14.0k managed to verify with the Double Counter bot. The following users were automatically considered verified:



If a user was blocked due to the use of a VPN but managed to verify without, it was considered verified.

Exceptions:

* Users that reached out in the verification-issues channel because they encountered technical issues or missed the verification, were added manually


To keep the verification process efficient and private, we have decided to go with the Double Counter bot. All verification attempts have been logged and served as the 
basis for our analysis.
 
* Registered: only users that registered their wallet in our Discord's #register channel 
* Verified: Users that got verified directly by the Double Counter bot, are holding an 888Whales NFT or are part of the quiz leaderboard

Users that have been verified after being blocked have been investigated on a manual basis. Some of them were unlocked. 


The DIVA Token claim has been allocated to users that have completed below.




Some users that have been blocked initially but were able to register afterwards

* **Registered**: You had to register
* **Verified**: 
* **888Whale NFT holder**: 
* **Quiz winners**: 

Rules:
* Registered and verified 
OR 
* Registered
* AND Verified OR 888Whales NFT holder OR Quiz winner
* AND Verified and manually unblocked



The verification process resulted in c. 50% of all registered accounts that interacted with the DIVA App being verified. 

Let us shed some light on the verification process:

We understand that despite the announcement 6 days ahead of the a verification process and a 3 day verification window, some users have missed the verification process due to 
personal reasons. Those that reached out via discord were added manually to the list of verified users. 


* Opened an issues channel in our discord to give users a chance to report if they had technical issues or missed the verification process. 
* Whale holders and quiz participants were automatically verified, even if they missed it.

* c. 1k users completed all tasks but didn't register (sent dUSD from their registered wallet)
* Users that completed the tasks with the several discord accounts but the same wallet will be counted once only


## What's next
Our main focus right now is getting the smart contracts ready for the second and final audit in January and prepare everything for the second testnet round. We will 
also continue with the quiz sessions again. Don't miss out as it will help you to prepare for the second testnet phase.

Note that the completion of all [testnet tasks](https://app.diva.finance/tasks) si mandatory to be eligible for all future reward rounds including the second testnet phase.

For those that are interested in the details of the verification process, read on.


## What comes next?

The testnet tasks will remaing available in the DIVA App. The completion of the tasks will serve as the entry ticket to all future reward rounds.

As already mentioned in some of our AMA sessions, this testnet was just the beginning. We are planning more rounds to reward users for learning and trying out DIVA Protocol. 

These include:
- Quiz
- DIVA exam
- Incentivized testnet phase 2  

Each initiative will be presented in more detail below. Participation in all initiatives assumes completion of all testnet tasks.

Learn-to-earn is the core concept underlying our token distribution strategy. We believe that this approach is more likely to convert users into long-term believers 
and supporters compared to a random airdrop model. 

### Quiz
The weekly quiz that is taking place in the DIVA discord offers users a great opportunity to earn additional DIVA tokens. Being the first answering a question yields 
100 DIVA tokens. Additional Super Quiz rounds where 10 correct user answers are possible and every users is only allowed to win once, hence giving every quiz participant a realistic chance to win. As of today, almost 25k DIVA tokens have been distributed via the quiz.
We will continue those quiz sessions for the foreseeable future to reward users that built up knowledge about DIVA Protocol. 


### Second incentivized testnet phase
The goal of the second testnet phase is to test additional features and integrations that we have been developing over the last couple of months. These include:
- Create offer flow
- Tellor oracle protocol integration

Please bear with us as we are preparing for that event. We will announce more details as soon as things are ready. 

## POAP
All testnet participants will receive a POAP that will serve as the entry ticket for the exam.

### Smart contract audit

## Mainnet launch

### Token generation event


## Bootstrapping the DIVA ecosystem
Our goal is to establish DIVA Protocol as the engine that powers a wide range of derivative applications including prediction markets, insurance platforms, structured products as well 
as event-driven conditional donations. [DIVA App](https://app.diva.finance/markets/0xBb0F479895915F80f6fEb5BABcb0Ad39a0D7eF4E) was just the beginning. To bootstrap the ecosystem, we 
will design frontend applications that can be built using DIVA Protocol as the engine. The goal is to give web2 developers inspiration and ideas what to build on top of DIVA Protocol.

These include platforms that offer users yield strategy products, twitter bets, spots bets,
insurance platforms, etc.
