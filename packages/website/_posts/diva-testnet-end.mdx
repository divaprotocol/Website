**TODO: Add link to Rewards page**


On 30th September, the first phase of DIVA's [incentivized testnet](#https://www.divaprotocol.io/posts/diva-testnet-announcement) has ended. The goal of the testnet was to invite users to explore the
functionality of the [DIVA App](#https://app.diva.finance/), collect valueable feedback to further improve the app ahead of
the mainnet launch beginning of next year and reward participants with a claim on the future DIVA token that will coincide with the mainnet launch.

The participation was overwhelming and has exceeded all our expectations. We want to say a big THANK YOU to everyone
who participated in our testnet. The huge participation was a real stress test for our app and helped us to iron
out some bugs that we wouldn't have spotted otherwise.

Here some key testnet statistics to highlight:

- Total contingent pools created: **170'000**
- Unique addresses participated: **26'100**
- Number accounts that completed all tasks: **13'800**
- Discord users: **33'000** (vs. 800 before the testnet)

## DIVA token reward
The most important metric that testnet participants are eagerly waiting for is the DIVA token reward that they receive for their participation. 
It took us a bit of time to finalize the numbers as the community requested an [additional verification step](https://www.divaprotocol.io/posts/diva-verification-announcement)
to filter out multi-accounts. That's why we go with the final testnet rewards first and provide a bit more details on the verification process as well as what's next in the following sections.

The DIVA token rewards for registered users that also passed the verification are as follows:

- **4.4** DIVA tokens per completed task (200 points)
- **100 DIVA** tokens for full completion (4500 points)
- **200 DIVA tokens** for full completion and ownership of an 888Whale NFT (9000 points)

You can check your reward on our [new website](https://www.divaprotocol.io/) 👀. Overall, a total of 1.12m DIVA tokens have been allocated to more than 13'600 users. That is
12% more than originally planned as we rounded up the rewards.

## Wen token?
Tokens can be claimed at the token generation event which is expected to coincide with the mainnet launch of the DIVA Protocol in Q1 2023. As a DIVA token holder you will 
have a say in the future direction of the protocol. In particular, you will be able to vote on protocol parameters such as fees as well as how to spend the DIVA treasury funds. 
There will be a maximum of 100m tokens with the majority being distributed over time (post mainnet) to those that use and build on top of DIVA Protocol. Read more about the DIVA tokenomics 
[here](https://docs.divaprotocol.io/introduction/what-is-diva-token).

## What's next?

* We will pick up the quiz sessions to prepare the community for the second testnet round. Make sure you participate or at least follow the questions and answers.
* Our main focus right now is getting the contracts ready for the final smart contract audit in January.
* 


For those that are interested in the details of the verification process, read on.


## Verification process
To exclude users that participated with multiple accounts to increase their allocation at the expense of honest single account users, we have conducted an additional
verification step as requested by the community. We decided to go with the Double Counter Discord bot as this was considered the most simple and efficient solution which didn't require users to share 
any personal information as it would be the case with KYC. 

Let's recap the timeline:
* 8th October: announcement of the verification process on Discord and Twitter
* 14th October: start of the verification process
* 17th October: end of the verification process

Registered accounts that fall in one of the following buckets were considerd verified:
* Accounts that got verified by the Double Counter bot on first attempt
* Accounts that were blocked on first attempt because of using a VPN but got verified by the Double Counter bot on second attempt
* Accounts that hold an [888Whales NFT](https://opensea.io/collection/888whales)
* Quiz winners

The verification process increased the reward by 75% for participants.

Roughly 2'000 accounts were blocked by the Double Counter bot during the verification process. We went through all the cases to study the patterns used by 
multi-accounts. Cognizant of households, that may have share that share the same WiFi those where it was not clear. 

During this exercise we have gained valuable insights into how to catch multi-accounts. To avoid giving those users ideas how to circumvent it, we have decided not to 
share the exact details of our analysis.


Despite giving sufficient heads-up and a three day verification window, we are aware that some community members were not able to verify due to personal issues. To address 
those cases, we have launched a #verification-issues channel in our Discord where users where asked to report. 

* Users that had technical issues or missed the verification process and reported their case in the verification-issues channel
* Users that were manually unblocked due to limited evidence of multi-accounts

Users that got verified on second or third attempt have been closely looked into. 

Accounts that are suspected being multi-accounts, none of the related accounts is eligible. 

As some users have experienced technical issues during the verification process, we opened up a verification-issues channel in our Discord on 18th October to give those
users a chance to report their case. We were also encouraging users to report if they had a valid reason. Multi-accounts that tried to exploit that process to get one of 
their accounts in were identified and ignored.


Out of the 26.1k accounts that participated in the testnet, roughly 13.7k participants were considered eligible.


roughly 14.0k managed to verify with the Double Counter bot. The following users were automatically considered verified:



If a user was blocked due to the use of a VPN but managed to verify without, it was considered verified.

Exceptions:

* Users that reached out in the verification-issues channel because they encountered technical issues or missed the verification, were added manually


To keep the verification process efficient and private, we have decided to go with the Double Counter bot. All verification attempts have been logged and served as the 
basis for our analysis.
 
* Registered: only users that registered their wallet in our Discord's #register channel 
* Verified: Users that got verified directly by the Double Counter bot, are holding an 888Whales NFT or are part of the quiz leaderboard

Users that have been verified after being blocked have been investigated on a manual basis. Some of them were unlocked. 


The DIVA Token claim has been allocated to users that have completed below.




Some users that have been blocked initially but were able to register afterwards

* **Registered**: You had to register
* **Verified**: 
* **888Whale NFT holder**: 
* **Quiz winners**: 

Rules:
* Registered and verified 
OR 
* Registered
* AND Verified OR 888Whales NFT holder OR Quiz winner
* AND Verified and manually unblocked



You can check your eligibility status.

The verification process resulted in c. 50% of all registered accounts that interacted with the DIVA App being verified. 

Let us shed some light on the verification process:

We understand that despite the announcement 6 days ahead of the a verification process and a 3 day verification window, some users have missed the verification process due to 
personal reasons. Those that reached out via discord were added manually to the list of verified users. 


* Opened an issues channel in our discord to give users a chance to report if they had technical issues or missed the verification process. 
* Whale holders and quiz participants were automatically verified, even if they missed it.





## DIVA token reward

The most important metric for testnet participants is the DIVA token reward that they have been promised for completing the testnet tasks. Before we mention the reward,
let's briefly recap the methodology that we have outlined in our [testnet announcement article](#https://www.divaprotocol.io/posts/diva-testnet-announcement) back in June:

> Each point collected represents a claim on one future DIVA token subject to a cap of 1 million DIVA tokens (1% of total supply).
> This means that if the aggregate points collected by all testnet users exceed 1 million, each user’s claim will be cut back pro-rata.
> For example, if the aggregate points collected by testnet users is 2 million, then each point will represent a claim on 0.5 DIVA tokens.
> For the avoidance of doubt, users that have collected more points than others will always receive more claims on the DIVA token.





To put things in perspective, 100 DIVA tokens is 50% larger than the 400 Uniswap token airdrop on a valuation adjusted basis. In dollar terms, the DIVA testnet reward 
would be worth c. $3.8k if DIVA had the same valuation as Uniswap (currently, $7.2bn fully diluted). This compares to $2.5k worth of UNI tokens that users received back in 
2020 assuming current prices. We want to stress that this comparison does not suggest that DIVA Protocol should be valued at $6.3bn. The market cap adjustment is a normalization that
helps to compare apples to apples. Using Lyra's valuation of $165m as a proxy, the token reward would be worth $99.

## Multi-accounts
We have been reported many cases where users created many accounts and completed all the tasks. The fact that more than 90% of users that completed all tasks required at least 30 minutes
to do that. The amount of effort that someone needs to put in to complete the tasks and no easy way to automate as the functions to interact with the smart contract were not made
public served as a Sybil protection mechanism. 

We have doubt to believe that some users have completed tasks 40-50 times as some claimed.

## Wen token?
Many users have asked when they will be able to claim their DIVA token reward. The token generation event is planned after we have completed all the envisaged 
community reward initiatives which are presented below in the article. We expect the DIVA token to go live in Q1 2023.  

## What comes next?

The testnet tasks will remaing available in the DIVA App. The completion of the tasks will serve as the entry ticket to all future reward rounds.

As already mentioned in some of our AMA sessions, this testnet was just the beginning. We are planning more rounds to reward users for learning and trying out DIVA Protocol. 

These include:
- Quiz
- DIVA exam
- Incentivized testnet phase 2  

Each initiative will be presented in more detail below. Participation in all initiatives assumes completion of all testnet tasks.

Learn-to-earn is the core concept underlying our token distribution strategy. We believe that this approach is more likely to convert users into long-term believers 
and supporters compared to a random airdrop model. 

### Quiz
The weekly quiz that is taking place in the DIVA discord offers users a great opportunity to earn additional DIVA tokens. Being the first answering a question yields 
100 DIVA tokens. Additional Super Quiz rounds where 10 correct user answers are possible and every users is only allowed to win once, hence giving every quiz participant a realistic chance to win. As of today, almost 25k DIVA tokens have been distributed via the quiz.
We will continue those quiz sessions for the foreseeable future to reward users that built up knowledge about DIVA Protocol. 

### DIVA exam
We are planning to conduct an exam where users can prove their knowledge about DIVA Protocol/App and get rewarded. Preliminary details about the exam (subject to change):
* Time: End of Q4
* Exam duration: 30 minutes
* Number of questions: 60-90
* Completion of all testnet tasks will be a requirement

As there will be only one exam, we will try to find a timeslot to accomodate all the timezones.  


However, you should not wait learning about DIVA Protocol. Do the testnet tasks, participate in the quiz, go through the old quiz questions and answers. Ask questions in the discord.
All of this will give you an edge during the exam.



Details will be announced over the next couple of weeks.

The exam will take place only once for 30 minutes. The completion of testnet tasks will be a requirement. Users can complete the tasks whenever they want. It is not a requirement to 
have completed the tasks during the first phase of the testnet. The fact that the exam will take place only once at one specifc point in time will help to prevent Sybil attacks and
reward honest users. We will make sure that a user will not be able to complete more than one exam in parallel.

The exam will reward those that did not blindly followed a youtube tutorial without learning anything.

### Incentivized testnet phase 2
The goal of the second testnet phase is to test additional features and integrations that we have been developing over the last couple of months. These include:
- Create offer flow
- Tellor oracle protocol integration

Please bear with us as we are preparing for that event. We will announce more details as soon as things are ready. 

## POAP
All testnet participants will receive a POAP that will serve as the entry ticket for the exam.

### Smart contract audit

### Mainnet launch

### Token generation event



Recent events...

We have to be honest.


## Observations
* c. 1k users completed all tasks but didn't register (sent dUSD from their registered wallet)
* Users that completed the tasks with the several discord accounts but the same wallet will be counted once only



**In progress:**

- **Create Offer flow:** We are adding an option for users to create derivative products in a more gas efficient and flexible way. Users will no longer have to create derivative products on-chain
  and take on the risk of not finding a counterparty. Instead, users will be able to create signed off-chain commitments to take either the long or short side of the derivative contract at very specific terms and share them
  with potential counterparties via various off-chain communication channels (e.g., email or chat). The derivative products are created only once a counterparty is found.
  Further, the Create Offer functionality will also remove the need for the creator to deposit the full collateral amount. Instead, a user can specify in the offer terms how much collateral each party has to contribute. With that,
  the sale of the long or short side, which in the current setup has to be conducted after a contingent pool has been created, would become part of the product creation process. The testing of the Create Offer flow will be part
  of the second testnet phase.
- **Show best bid/ask on Markets page:** An efficient way to display the best bid/ask rates on the Markets page is under development.

## Smart contracts

- The EIP712 module which enables the Create Offer flow described above has been integrated into DIVA Protocol. We are preparing everything for another audit round to
  ensure that the new functionality is bug-free and secure.
- Before we go to audit, we are planning an incentivized code review program where we will invite Solidity developers and reward them in claims on the future DIVA token for reviewing and providing feedback on the code.
  This will help to raise awareness about DIVA Protocol in developer circles and foster adoption when it is launched on mainnet.

## Testnet

The incentivized testnet has been an overwhelming success in all respects. We received a lot of helpful feedback from our users, fixed several bugs and were able to grow our discord community
from 800 to over 15k members. The on-going testnet is running until September 30, 2022, but we can already announce that there will be another round of incentivized testnet where users will get a chance
to earn additional rewards for trying out new features that are currently under development.

### Key testnet statistics

We want to be transparent with our community and share the expected DIVA token reward from participating in our testnet. 1% (1 million tokens) of the total DIVA token supply was reserved for the on-going testnet which will be allocated to all testnet participants pro-rata to their points collected. If the testnet ended today,
each participant that has completed all the testnet tasks would be rewarded with slightly more than 210 DIVA tokens (c. $21 assuming a $10 million project valuation). Below the details including additional testnet statistics:

- Total pools created: >60k
- Unique addresses participated: >10k
- Number users that completed all tasks: >2300
- Total points collected: 21.3m
- DIVA token reward for completing all tasks: 210 DIVA tokens

While further participation will dilute the testnet reward per user, we want to highlight that the completion of all testnet tasks will be beneficial for future reward rounds and initiatives.

## Quiz

End of July, we announced an incentivized [quiz](https://www.divaprotocol.io/posts/diva-incentivized-diva-quiz) where we give users a chance to earn additional claims
on the future DIVA token by proving their knowledge about DIVA Protocol and the DIVA App. The quiz has gained a lot of traction with 37 community members being able to secure a spot
on the leaderboard. It was particularly great to see that some members have built very solid knowledge and leveraged that to earn additional DIVA tokens.

Unfortunately, the quiz was interrupted for a few days due to the issues that we experienced during the migration. We expect to resume the quiz very soon.

The quiz is one of many initiatives that we are planning to build an informed and knowledgeable community.
If you haven't followed all the questions but want to test your knowledge about DIVA Protocol, head over to our [documentation](https://docs.divaprotocol.io/guides/quiz) where you will find all questions.
It was a conscious decision to not publish the answers yet to increase the learn effect ;-)

## Farmer insurance

The [article on the farmer insurance](https://www.divaprotocol.io/posts/diva-how-diva-protocol-can-help-unlock-affordable-insurance-for-farmers) use case sparked some excitement
with some organizations in Africa. We are currently exploring a pilot program with a set of farmers to test it out. Stay tuned!

## Join us

DIVA Protocol will enable the peer-to-peer creation of financial derivative products and with that unlock use cases that haven't been possible before. If you are interested in what we are building, join us on
