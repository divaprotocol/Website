We are excited to announce the highly anticipated mainnet launch of DIVA Protocol. This marks a significant milestone in 
our mission to disrupt the $500+ trillion derivatives industry. With DIVA Protocol on mainnet, users can now create and manage custom 
derivative financial contracts, peer-to-peer, with digital assets of actual value at stake.

This article covers everything you need to know about the launch and the journey that lies ahead.

## üöÄ Mainnet chains

On 4/5th June, DIVA Protocol was successfully deployed on multiple mainnet chains, including [Ethereum](https://louper.dev/diamond/0x2C9c47E7d254e493f02acfB410864b9a86c28e1D?network=mainnet), 
[Polygon](https://louper.dev/diamond/0x2C9c47E7d254e493f02acfB410864b9a86c28e1D?network=polygon), [Arbitrum One](https://louper.dev/diamond/0x2C9c47E7d254e493f02acfB410864b9a86c28e1D?network=arbitrum), 
and [Gnosis](https://louper.dev/diamond/0x2C9c47E7d254e493f02acfB410864b9a86c28e1D?network=xdai), all at the same address: **0x2C9c47E7d254e493f02acfB410864b9a86c28e1D**

To demonstrate our commitment to transparency, we have open-sourced the [DIVA Protocol GitHub repository](https://github.com/divaprotocol/diva-protocol-v1/tree/main), 
enabling anyone to verify the functionality of the DIVA Protocol smart contract.

As an EVM-chain-agnostic software, DIVA Protocol will expand its presence on additional chains in the future to 
further grow the user base. 

## üçé DIVA App

We are thrilled to announce that the DIVA App ([app.diva.finance](https://app.diva.finance/)), an OTC marketplace to create, trade and settle custom derivative contracts, 
powered by DIVA Protocol, is now live on Polygon mainnet (and Mumbai for testing). We would like to express our sincere gratitude to our passionate community members who 
actively participated in the [incentivized testnet in Q2 2022](https://www.divaprotocol.io/posts/diva-testnet-end) and helped to stress test and improve the DIVA App.

The migration of the DIVA App from Goerli to the final smart contracts on Polygon was the main contributor to the delay between the mainnet deployment and this official announcement. We thank our community for their patience.

## üîí Smart contract audit

The security of the DIVA Protocol smart contract is our top priority. In order to ensure the safety of the protocol 
and user funds, we have engaged six independent teams to review the codebase. We are proud to report that none of the 
audit teams found any critical vulnerabilities. The few High and Medium findings have been addressed. A summary of 
the findings as well as the actual audit reports are available in the [DIVA Protocol GitHub repository](https://github.com/divaprotocol/diva-protocol-v1/blob/main/audits/Final%20April%202023/Summary.md).

A special acknowledgement goes to [Owen](https://twitter.com/0xOwenThurm) and his teams at [Solidity Labs](https://github.com/GuardianAudits/DefenderAudits/blob/main/DIVA/Summary.md) who performed the audit as part of a practice 
audit and discovered unique findings that none of the paid audit firms were able to uncover.

## ü™ô DIVA Token

The DIVA Token ([0x4B7fFCB2b92fB4890f22f62a52Fb7A180eaB818e](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4B7fFCB2b92fB4890f22f62a52Fb7A180eaB818e)) was deployed 
alongside the mainnet launch on the Ethereum network due to its crucial role in the DIVA ecosystem. DIVA Token holders have the power to influence the direction of the 
protocol by delegating the management of the treasury funds and (limited) protocol governance rights to candidates of their choosing.

Initially, DIVA Technologies AG, a Swiss-based entity led by [Wladimir Weinbender](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wladimir-weinbender-00450a59/), one of the Co-Founders of DIVA Protocol, will serve as the 
first delegate. The delegate‚Äôs role is to support DIVA Token holders in executing the adoption strategy in an efficient 
and effective manner.

It is important to highlight that DIVA Token holders retain the power to vote in favor of another candidate at any point 
in time in a fully decentralized manner. For a detailed understanding of the voting mechanism, we invite you to explore 
our previous [blog post](https://www.divaprotocol.io/posts/diva-tokenomics).

### DIVA Token distribution

A total of 34 million DIVA Tokens, out of the maximum supply of 100 million, have been allocated among three main groups, 
spanning across 17‚Äô482 accounts:
* **Contributors** (27.2 million): Individuals who have made direct or indirect contributions to the development of DIVA Protocol, 
associated integrations and applications. This includes members of the [founding team](https://www.divaprotocol.io/about), [Tellor Protocol](https://tellor.io/), [Fortune Credit](https://fortuneconnectltd.com/), 
[Shamba Network](https://shamba.network/), [GoPlugin](https://www.goplugin.co/), [Solidity Labs](https://github.com/GuardianAudits/DefenderAudits/blob/main/DIVA/Summary.md), [DIVA Donate campaign donors](https://www.divaprotocol.io/posts/diva-donate-launch), 
[888Whales holders](https://www.divaprotocol.io/posts/diva-token-airdrop-for-888whales), [audit sponsors](https://www.divaprotocol.io/posts/diva-launch-partner-program), and select core 
contributors to the Ethereum ecosystem.
* **Pre-seed investors** (5.5 million): Our early financial supporters who have played a crucial role in the foundational 
stages of DIVA Protocol. These include [Darley Technologies AG](https://www.darleytechnologies.com/), [DWF Labs](https://www.dwf-labs.com/), and family & friends.
* **Testnet and quiz participants** (1.3 million): Users who participated in the [incentivized testnet](https://www.divaprotocol.io/posts/diva-testnet-end) held in 2022 and the regular 
quiz sessions.

Recipients of more than 15‚Äô000 DIVA tokens are subject to a two-year vesting period, during which 60% of their allocation will be vested. 
This includes the founding team members as well as pre-seed investors. Consequently, the initial circulating supply will amount to 
15.7 million tokens.

The remaining 66 million tokens were deposited into the DIVA Development Fund (more details further down below) and will be programmatically unlocked 
at a rate of 2.2 million tokens p.a. over a period of 30 years. Taking into account the vesting and DIVA Token unlock, the circulating supply will 
increase to approximately 38.4 million tokens by the end of year 2.

The chart below illustrates the token distribution over time:

### How to claim your DIVA Token reward?

Head over to the [Rewards](https://www.divaprotocol.io/rewards) tab on our website, connect your wallet to the Ethereum network and claim your reward.

The data required to prove to the smart contract that you are eligible to claim was backed up on [IPFS](https://bafybeidfzdmv25a3m2iz2ptcm2qso4yupywur7u5ijnagwkqi5pzqc5mtu.ipfs.w3s.link/vestingToken.json), which 
allows anyone to claim their tokens even if the website is no longer available.

Please note that you have ***three years to claim your reward**. Any unclaimed rewards will be claimable by the owner of the token distribution contract afterwards.

### What can you do with your DIVA Token?

Once you have claimed your DIVA Token from the DIVA Protocol website, you have several options available:
* **Vote** (intended use): Stake your tokens towards the first delegate, DIVA Technologies AG (0x1062CCC9F9a4bBcf565799683b6c00eA525ECb9F), or 
select another candidate of your choice. In the next section, we provide a step-by-step description of how to stake your tokens.
* **Sell**: Since the DIVA Token complies with the ERC20 standard, you have the option to sell it on any decentralized exchange (DEX).
* **HODL**: Don‚Äôt feel comfortable doing any of the above? Then simply HODL.

### How to vote with your DIVA Token?

To vote with your DIVA Tokens towards for a candidate of your choice, follow these steps:
* Navigate to the [DIVA Token contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4B7fFCB2b92fB4890f22f62a52Fb7A180eaB818e#writeContract) on Etherscan and use the **approve** function to allow the 
[Ownership contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xE39dEC81B2186A1A2e36bFC260F3Df444b36948A#writeContract) to transfer your DIVA tokens. 
Set the spender as 0xE39dEC81B2186A1A2e36bFC260F3Df444b36948A, and the amount equal to the number of tokens you want to stake appended 
with 18 zeros (e.g., enter 125000000000000000000 for 125 tokens).
* Proceed to the [Ownership contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xE39dEC81B2186A1A2e36bFC260F3Df444b36948A#writeContract) on Etherscan and execute the **stake** function using the candidate address and the number of tokens you 
wish to stake, also appended with 18 zeros. Note that the amount must be equal or smaller than the one approved in the previous step.

Please note that we are actively developing a more user-friendly governance dashboard to enhance the voting experience in the future.

## üè¶ DIVA Development Fund

The DIVA Development Fund was established to provide an opportunity for everyone to support the ongoing development of the DIVA ecosystem. 
Individuals can contribute to the fund by depositing ETH or any other ERC20 token (excluding rebasable and fee tokens) into the fund. This 
can be done either by directly sending assets to the Ethereum contract ([0xb3e25F6c7d1074f2cfE0F2Dc8586D1e74234338b](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb3e25F6c7d1074f2cfE0F2Dc8586D1e74234338b#code)), allowing for immediate 
claimability by the owner (initially DIVA Technologies AG), or by using the deposit function, which enables specifying a release period.

As part of our commitment to fostering community growth and development, the DIVA Protocol founding team has deposited 66 million (66%) of 
unreleased DIVA Tokens into the DIVA Development fund, subject to a 30-year release period. The intention is to distribute them strategically 
in a retroactive manner to future contributors. This initiative draws inspiration from Optimism's Retroactive Public Good Funding program. 
More comprehensive information about the Retroactive DIVA Ecosystem Funding program will be shared in a separate article.

**Note:** Out of the 66 million unreleased tokens, [8 million tokens](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x1b69c2486f997cb5245940eb5fe0891a7e641fadcbdd5c8e297ac550d8deb3aa) have been temporarily reserved for on-going sale discussions with potential investors and 
are immediately claimable by the initial delegate DIVA Technologies AG. If fundraising efforts do not materialize, these 8 million tokens will 
be re-deposited into the Development Fund and subject to the same 30-year release period as the remaining [58 million tokens](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe54868c06ea3c89ff1499ec395a5d1e8743bbccfa4d6c3c346045b7638253029).
